# Readme for Nikkei business online.js 



`Nikkei business online.js` is a web translator for the bibliographic software, Zotero. This will allow you to store articles in [日経ビジネスオンライン](http://business.nikkeibp.co.jp/) into your Zotero library.

Although I have made [a Pull Request](https://github.com/zotero/translators/pull/1427) for [Zotero translators](https://github.com/zotero/translators), it's stuck and has not been added to Zotero. I decided to create a separate repo on its own.



## Installation 

1. Find and open your Zotero data directory from Preferences > Advanced > Files and Folders > Data  Directory Location > Show Data  Directory.
2. Find the folder `translators`
3. Download `Nikkei business online.js` and place it in the `translators` folder.
